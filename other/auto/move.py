text = "Work on what would become the Antonov An 225 would begin in 1984 with a from the Soviet government for a large airlifter as a replacement for the Myasishchev VM-T.[1] The specifics of this request included the ability to carry a maximum payload of 231,838 kilograms (511,116 lb), both externally and internally, while operating from any runway of at least 3,500 metres (11,500 ft). As originally set out, the mission and objectives were broadly identical to that of the United States' Shuttle Carrier Aircraft, having been designed to airlift the Energia rocket's boosters and the Buran-class orbiters for the Soviet space program.[2][1] Furthermore, a relatively short timetable for the delivery of the completed aircraft meant that development would have to proceed at a rapid pace.[1]The An-225 carrying Buran (1.01) in 1989Accordingly, the Antonov Design Bureau decided to produce a derivative of their existing Antonov An-124 Ruslan airlifter, although its payload capacity was almost half of what was required.[1] The aircraft was stretched via the addition of fore and aft fuselage barrel sections, while a new enlarged wing centre was designed that facilitated the carriage of an additional pair of Progress D-18T turbofan engines, increasing the total from four to six powerplants. A completely new tail was also required to handle the wake turbulence generated by the bulky external loads that would be carried on the aircraft's upper fuselage.[1] Despite the novelty of its scale, the design of the An 225 was largely conventional.[3] The lead designer of the An-225 (and the An-124) was Viktor Tolmachev.[4]On 21 December 1988, the An-225 performed its maiden flight.[5][6] It made its first public appearance outside of the Soviet Union at the 1989 Paris Air Show where it was presented while carrying a Buran orbiter.[7] One year later, it performed a flying display for the public days at the Farnborough Air Show. While two aircraft had been ordered, only a single An-225, (registration CCCP-82060, later UR-82060[8]) was finished. It could carry ultra-heavy and oversized freight weighing up to 250,000 kg (550,000 lb) internally[2] or 200,000 kg (440,000 lb) on the upper fuselage. Cargo on the upper fuselage can be up to 70 m (230 ft) in length.[9]A second An-225 was partially built during the late 1980s for the Soviet space program, however, work on the airframe was suspended following the collapse of the Soviet Union. By 2000, the need for additional An-225 capacity had become apparent; during September 2006, it was decided that the second An-225 would be completed, a feat that was at one point scheduled to occur around 2008. However, the work was subject to repeated delays.[10] By August 2009, the aircraft had not been completed and work had been abandoned.[11][12] In May 2011, the Antonov CEO reportedly stated that the completion of the second An-225, which would have a carrying capacity of 250 tons, requires at least $300 million; upon the provision of sufficient financing, its completion could be achieved in three years.[13] According to different sources, the second aircraft was 60–70% complete by 2016.[14][15][16]The An-225 at Farnborough in 1990The revival of space activities involving the An-225 was repeatedly announced and speculated upon throughout its life. During the early 2000s, studies were conducted into the production of an even larger An-225 derivative, the eight-engined Antonov An-325, which was intended to be used in conjunction with Russia's in-development MAKS space plane.[17] In April 2013, the Russian government announced plans to revive Soviet-era air launch projects that would use a purpose-built modification to the An-225 as a midair launchpad.[18][needs update]In May 2017, Airspace Industry Corporation of China (AICC)'s president, Zhang You-Sheng, informed a BBC reporter that AICC had first contemplated cooperation with Antonov in 2009 and made contact with them two years later. AICC intends to modernize the second unfinished An-225 and develop it into an air launch to orbit platform for commercial satellites at altitudes up to 12,000 m (39,000 ft).[5] The aviation media cast doubt on the production restart, speculating that the ongoing Russia–Ukraine conflict would prevent various necessary components that would have been sourced from Russia from being delivered; it may be possible that China could manufacture them instead.[19] That project did not move forward but UkrOboronProm, the parent company of Antonov, had continued to seek partners to finish the second airframe.[20]On 25 March 2020, the first An-225 commenced a series of test flights from Hostomel Airport near Kyiv, after more than a year out of service, for the installation of a domestically designed power management and control system."
